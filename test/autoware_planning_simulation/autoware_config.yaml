# Autoware Planning Simulator Configuration for play_launch
# This configuration is optimized for Autoware's planning simulator

# Composable node loading settings
composable_node_loading:
  # Delay before loading composable nodes (milliseconds)
  # Autoware has many containers, give them time to initialize
  delay_load_node_millis: 2000

  # Timeout for loading each composable node (milliseconds)
  # Autoware has 50+ composable nodes, some may take longer to load
  load_node_timeout_millis: 60000

  # Maximum retry attempts for loading composable nodes
  load_node_attempts: 3

  # Maximum concurrent composable node loading operations
  # Autoware benefits from parallel loading but too many can overwhelm the system
  max_concurrent_load_node_spawn: 10

# Container readiness checking settings
container_readiness:
  # Wait for container services to be available via ROS service discovery
  # Default is true, but explicitly set here for Autoware
  wait_for_service_ready: true

  # Maximum time to wait for each container service (seconds)
  # Autoware's containers may take longer to fully initialize
  service_ready_timeout_secs: 300

  # Interval for polling container service availability (milliseconds)
  service_poll_interval_ms: 500

# Resource monitoring settings
monitoring:
  # Enable monitoring (can be overridden by --enable-monitoring flag)
  enabled: false

  # Sampling interval in milliseconds
  sample_interval_ms: 1000

# Process-specific configurations
# Uncomment and modify as needed for Autoware-specific tuning
# processes:
#   # Apply process control to all component containers
#   - node_pattern: "NODE 'rclcpp_components/component_container*"
#     monitor: true
#     cpu_affinity: [0, 1]
#     nice: 5
#
#   # Higher priority for critical containers
#   - node_pattern: "NODE '/control/control_container'"
#     monitor: true
#     cpu_affinity: [0, 1]
#     nice: -5  # Requires CAP_SYS_NICE capability
#
#   # Lower priority for visualization
#   - node_pattern: "NODE 'rviz2/rviz2*"
#     monitor: false
#     nice: 10
